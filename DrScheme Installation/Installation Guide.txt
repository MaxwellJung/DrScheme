DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING DrScheme

DOWNLOADING
1. Go to http://www.plt-scheme.org/.
2. On the box that tells you "PLT Scheme is now Racket", click the "[close]"
   box in the top right corner.  (You will be doing this several times.
   It's annoying, but remember you only need to download this once.)
3. Click "Download PLT Scheme" on the right side of the web page.
4. On the box that tells you "PLT Scheme is now Racket", click the "[close]"
   box in the top right corner.
5. IMPORTANT: You want v372 of DrScheme! Note that the default is
   Version 4.2.5.  However, on the right hand side of the web page, there
   is a link for "Other Versions".  Click the "Other Versions" link.
6. On the box that tells you "PLT Scheme is now Racket", click the "[close]"
   box in the top right corner.
7. Select "v372" from the menu, then click the "Go" button.
8. On the box that tells you "PLT Scheme is now Racket", click the "[close]"
   box in the top right corner.
9. Select the operating system that applies for your computer, then click
   the "Download" button.
10. On the box that tells you "PLT Scheme is now Racket", click the "[close]"
   box in the top right corner.
11. Choose a location from which to download.  (It doesn't matter which you
   select.)
12. Save the file wherever it is convenient.

INSTALLING
1. Execute the file you downloaded.  On Linux, this is
   plt-372-bin-i386-linux.sh.  On Windows, it is
   plt-372-bin-i386-win32.exe.  On the Mac, it is
   plt-372-bin-i386-osx-mac.dmg.
2. You will be prompted for where you want to put the PLT Scheme
   stuff.  On Linux, I recommend creating a directory called
   /opt/plt and specify that as the location.  On Windows, 
   I recommend that you choose C:/Program Files/PLT.  (If you
   want to use a different drive than the C drive, by all means
   do so; I am just using C in this example.)

That's it!  You can now run Scheme on your computer.  Assuming you
followed the installation directions to the letter, on Linux, you
would find the program at /opt/plt/bin/drscheme.  On Windows, look
in C:/Program Files/PLT/DrScheme.exe.  On the Mac, it will be under
/Applications/PLT/DrScheme.

RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME
1. When you run DrScheme for the first time, you will be presented
   a window with "Choose Language" on the title bar.  You do NOT
   want the default which is "Beginning Student."  What do do want is:
	PLT --> Graphical (MrEd, includes MzScheme)
   Select it and click OK.
2. Click Run at the top right of the DrScheme window.
   On subsequent uses of DrScheme, this should remain the default.

SIMPLY SCHEME ADDITIONS 

There are files that we will need to run Scheme like the examples in the 
book.  Complete the following steps:

1) Download and uncompress the folder from the scheme.zip file provided for 
you (labeled "Scheme Files" in the Welcome folder). 

2) Drag the whole folder into the PLT folder you created (see above)


Use (load /Applications/PLT/scheme/simply.scm) command in definitions window
to run these properly.

For other special Simply Scheme files, replace "simply.scm" with
whatever filename you wish to load ("functions.scm", "ttt.scm", etc.).
(These files depend on "simply.scm" being loaded first, so you will
have multiple load commands in the Definitions window in DrScheme.)
